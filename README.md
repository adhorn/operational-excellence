## 1. Operational Readiness Review Template

An ORR is a rigorous, evidence-based assessment that evaluates a particular service's operational state and is often very specific to a specific company, its culture, and its tools. Yet, ORRs all have the same goal: help you find blind spots in your operations.

## 2. Postmortem Template

### Compagnion blog post - [Incident Postmortem Template](https://adhorn.medium.com/incident-postmortem-template-7b0e0a04f7a8)

A postmortem is a process where a team reflects on a problem — for example, an unexpected loss of redundancy, or perhaps a failed software deployment — and documents what the problem was and how to avoid it in the future.
